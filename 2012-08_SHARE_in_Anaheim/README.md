## [When Things Go Wrong: Abends in Your Assembler Program and How You Can Recover From Them](Abend_Recovery_Anaheim_2012_08_10.pdf)

In this session we will explain what an ABEND is, what z/OS does when an ABEND occurs, and will discuss techniques your assembler routines can use to deal with ABENDs or even fully recover from them.

We’ll show an example of a very simple recovery routine (ESTAE) and we’ll explain important concepts, rules and parts of the Recovery Termination Manager (RTM) such as PIC, FLIH, RTM, (E)SPIE, (E)STAE, SDWA, RTM2WA, FRR, etc. We will also discuss common issues and "surprises" when dealing with recovery routines.

This session is targeted primarily towards assembler programmers but it will also provide a refresher of z/OS ABEND processing and recovery concepts in general.

## [Making Assembler Cool Again with z/OS UNIX](Assembler_Cool_Again_handout.pdf)

Do you have a great product or application written in assembler? Would you like to access it from z/OS UNIX? Or would you just like to learn more about doing this?

In this session we will try to clear up the myths surrounding the relationship between MVS and z/OS UNIX. We will show you a simple assembler program running under z/OS UNIX and we’ll discuss how things differ in this environment compared to good old MVS batch and TSO. And if you come loaded with questions we’ll be happy to help answer them. After attending this session you’ll feel more comfortable about assembler programming in the z/OS UNIX world and you’ll understand the cool things you can do with it. This session will focus on assembler. No Java, no C++, JUST assembler!

## [z/OS UNIX for all](Anaheim_Unix_for_all.pdf)

Are you a Linux geek who is new to the z/OS environment? Are you a z/OS veteran who needs to learn about the UNIX part of z/OS? There are many UNIX tutorials on the web. But none of them specific to z/OS. Yet z/OS UNIX is probably the most exotic flavor of UNIX with exceptions at almost every corner. Instead of taking you through a tutorial you may find boring or feel unfamiliar with we will pick one from the web and put it to the context of z/OS and extend it for platform specific content. You may then choose to concentrate only on the differences or do the whole tutorial but now adjusted specifically for YOU while talking the language you already know!
