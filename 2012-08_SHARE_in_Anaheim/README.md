## [z/OS UNIX for all](Anaheim_Unix_for_all.pdf)

Are you a Linux geek who is new to the z/OS environment? Are you a z/OS veteran who needs to learn about the UNIX part of z/OS? There are many UNIX tutorials on the web. But none of them specific to z/OS. Yet z/OS UNIX is probably the most exotic flavor of UNIX with exceptions at almost every corner. Instead of taking you through a tutorial you may find boring or feel unfamiliar with we will pick one from the web and put it to the context of z/OS and extend it for platform specific content. You may then choose to concentrate only on the differences or do the whole tutorial but now adjusted specifically for YOU while talking the language you already know!
